# Venom 3: The Last Dance - Everything You Need to Know About the Upcoming 2024 Movie

Marvel fans, get ready for an epic conclusion! *Venom 3: The Last Dance*, the highly anticipated final installment in the Venom trilogy, is set to hit theaters in 2024, bringing Eddie Brock and his symbiote Venom back for one last darkly humorous and action-packed adventure. Let's dive deep into all the essential details, from plot spoilers and villains to release dates and streaming options.

## Release Date and Where to Watch *Venom 3: The Last Dance*

Mark your calendars for June 28, 2024! Initially slated for a 2024 release, the pandemic caused delays, but Sony Pictures confirms that this final date is set. 

For those eager to stream it, *Venom 3* will have an exclusive theatrical release first. As of now, there are no official plans for same-day streaming. However, if past Sony-Marvel releases like *Venom* and *Venom: Let There Be Carnage* serve as a guide, fans can expect it on Netflix a few months after the theater release, potentially by early 2025.

## The Plot of *Venom 3: The Last Dance*

The storyline of *Venom 3* promises an emotional, action-heavy roller coaster. Eddie Brock and Venom face their most devastating enemy yet, as they must battle the eldritch god Knull, the dark creator of the symbiotes. Knull aims to enslave Earth and has dispatched a fearsome force of Xenophages—monstrous alien hunters—to accomplish this goal.

In a climactic finale, Venom and Eddie make a shocking decision: Venom sacrifices himself to destroy the Codex, a powerful entity, to stop Knull and the Xenophages. Eddie is ejected from the battlefield just as Venom leads Knull's army into a deadly trap, cementing Venom’s legacy as a true anti-hero.

## Major Characters in *Venom 3*

- **Eddie Brock / Venom** (played by Tom Hardy): Eddie returns with his symbiote, Venom, to defend humanity against its darkest threat yet.
- **Knull**: Known as the King in Black, Knull is the most ancient and powerful of the symbiotes, wielding vast dark energy and aiming to conquer all life.
- **Strickland**: A mysterious military figure with his motives, Strickland’s role in the story remains cryptic, but he’s a key antagonist.

This dynamic cast promises to keep fans at the edge of their seats as they explore the struggles of morality, loyalty, and survival.

## Will We See Spider-Man in *Venom 3*?

Despite fan hopes, there’s no indication that Spider-Man will make an appearance in *Venom 3*. Sony has chosen to keep the Venom universe separate from the MCU, even with the immense potential for crossover appeal. While the two characters share a comic book history, *Venom 3* will conclude the trilogy without Spider-Man, giving Venom a chance to shine independently in his final outing.

## Age Rating and Audience for *Venom 3*

*Venom 3: The Last Dance* has a PG-13 rating due to its intense action, horror themes, and mild language, making it suitable for older teens and adults. Like its predecessors, it combines gallows humor with darker, horror-inspired elements, which has become a hallmark of the franchise.

## When Can You Expect *Venom 3* on Streaming Platforms?

Given Sony’s past releases, *Venom 3* will likely arrive on streaming platforms about three months after its theatrical debut. Fans in the U.S. can anticipate seeing it on Netflix by early 2025. Platforms like Amazon Prime Video and Apple TV may also offer it for digital purchase or rent around the same timeframe. 

## Critical Reception and Fan Expectations

Fans and critics alike are awaiting the release of *Venom 3* with high expectations, especially since it concludes a beloved franchise. Known for its unique blend of horror, comedy, and gritty action, *Venom* stands out from the traditional superhero fare, making it popular among a diverse audience. The trailer showcases intense sequences, epic battles, and emotional farewells, hinting that *Venom 3* will deliver a fitting and memorable conclusion.

## Conclusion: Is *Venom 3: The Last Dance* the End?

*Venom 3: The Last Dance* marks the final chapter in the Venom trilogy, closing a thrilling narrative arc for Eddie Brock and Venom. The trilogy has provided fans with a refreshing and darkly comedic take on the superhero genre, diverging from mainstream Marvel themes and becoming an iconic character study. So, get ready to bid farewell to Venom in this climactic finale—it’s bound to be an unforgettable last dance. 

*Stay tuned for more updates on where to watch, behind-the-scenes exclusives, and all the details as we get closer to the release of Venom 3: The Last Dance.*
